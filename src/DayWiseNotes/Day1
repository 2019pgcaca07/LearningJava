Arrays.sort() ->In Java, the Arrays.sort() method, which is used for sorting arrays, typically employs a
 dual-pivot Quicksort algorithm for primitive types and a modified merge sort for objects. The specific sorting
 algorithm used by Arrays.sort() can vary between different Java implementations and versions.
 As of Java 7, the sorting algorithm used by Arrays.sort() for primitive types (like int, long, etc.) is based on
 the dual-pivot Quicksort algorithm. This algorithm was introduced to improve the performance of Quicksort on
 certain types of input.
 For objects (non-primitive types), the sorting algorithm is a modified version of TimSort,
 which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. TimSort is
 designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data and is the default sorting algorithm
 for objects.

static keyword:1.We can marked member of a class[field,method,nested class] as static.
               2.As we marked class member as static means these ,members are class level and not depends
                on instances of class.
                3.we can use inside the class and outside class by using class Name directly.
                4.we can also fetch it by instances of class.
